MIDTERM README

For my midterm project, I would like to write a program that sits inside your browswer and acts a a productivitiy monitor.
-When the user initilizes the program they can set either a timer to count down to a specific time (such as 30 minutes) or start a timer to track their time spent on the page.
-When the timer is counting down and runs out it will alert the user
-Will be designed to help the user measure the time they spend on websites.
